About the API

you can use this api to get the data for processing,
however be aware that according to traffic this might be quite slow.

to use the api:
 {###.herokuapp.com}/api/{algorithm shorthand}?dataset={dataset}&graph={graphtype}&slice={RR timeslice}&type={MLFB type}
 
 {dataset}: either 10000, 20000, 50000
 {graphtype}: either 'wait' or 'nTAT' (normalised turnaround time)
 {slice}: only for RR (in JIFFY's: 1 JIFFY = 10ms)
 {MLFB type}: default is constant, if you want the linear distribution use 'linear'
 
 response will be formatted in JSON as follows:
 [{percentile=1, value=x},{second datapoint},...{percentile=100, value=y}]
 
 this value will be the nTAT or the wait-time as specified in the request-URI
